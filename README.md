## Real lessons from fairy tales

**Fairy tales are more than just light entertainment, they help teach the basics of social behavior. Ever think about the messages hidden in your favorite  fairy tales?**

#### A life message from another world 

Fairy tales are important to children at any age – and some adults too.  Their descriptions of epic quests and persevering in the face of adversity have an amazing hold on our imaginations.  They tell children that even the weakest can succeed in life. From fairy tales, children learn that if they trust their abilities, think smart, and work hard – they can succeed in the end. 

#### Identification with the hero

*The characters in fairy tales are archetypical* – kings, outsiders, princesses, and wizards to name a few. And, they also have an opposing figure trying to stop them.  This storyline helps children make a close connection to “their” character, with girls often identifying themselves with a princesses and boys with knights.

#### Choose between good and evil

*The main heroes are always good* – even though they make mistakes. As they progress towards the goal, they also fight against greed, theft, and offensive behavior in others. By the end of a fairy tale, all misdeeds have been punished with the good characters winning rewards and love.  The clear contrast between good and evil helps preschool children understand basic moral values. 

#### Finding the borders to a fairy tale world

*The golden age of fairy tales is probably with preschoolers.* Children at this age need adventure and a clear structure – and fairy tales offer both. While older children still like fairy tales, they often progress to more complicated stories with less clear-cut storylines.  If a child seems stuck on a fairy tale which is clearly below his or her age level, then bring in a more advanced version or introduce other story-time activities. 

#### Real life parent-child interactions

*Fairy tales can have a real impact on parent-child relationships.* Experts advise parents to make a regular time and space for storytelling – which often are fairy tales. Not only is this time a natural introduction to reading, it becomes a rewarding ritual where both parent and child can relax and talk together.
